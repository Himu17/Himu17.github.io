					Though they might not seem like it, human babies are good at picking up

					are capable of. Babies were shown to mimic mouth movements (sticking out their tongue,
					pursing their lips, etc.) in studies; a possible explanation for this mimicry is humans'
					knack for picking up culture. This knack for picking up culture could very well stem from
					human's ability to communicate so well. Even babies who can't yet speak can tell the difference
					between language and gibberish. Some animals have certain calls or signals they communicate with,
					but nothing compares to the complexity and intricacy of human speech.

								Though brains are hard-wired certain ways, change happens, through
								experience or otherwise, that can change the structure of the brain,
								and therefore, the mind. Infants have had to have a hemisphere
								of their brain removed (a very rare occurrence, only to stop monumental

								of the removed one, allowing the children to learn things like language
								almost as good, or just as good as children with both hemispheres.

								<p>Adult brains, in humans, aren't able to change as dramatically

								of the brain devoted to use of a specific finger would transfer
								to the other fingers when the finger they were allocated for was
								amputated. Once there was no use for the area of the brain, it
								was gradually put back to work with the existing body parts.</p>

					Everyone knows that body parts can recover from injury. Even such injuries as
					breaking a bone heal after a while, so it shouldn't be surprising that the brain
					is the same way. The only bit about this that may be surprising is how the brain's
					cells are almost always the same, not being constantly replaced like other body parts.
					The organs, brain included, have redunencies in place so that if one part (for example,
					one hemisphere) fails, the other, or other similar structures, can take over its
					workload to an extent. If needed, cells in certain parts of the brain can change
					to take on new responsibilities for parts of the brain that may be damaged or missing.

					Genes don't seem to directly affect actions, in humans or other animals, but the
					parts of the brain that deals with said actions. No one gene causes people to do
					a specific complex action (like socializing), but there are most likely genes
					that control things like peoples' urge to have social comfort. People who are more
					likely to do certain actions than others don't do so because of a gene, but the
					combination of <em>many</em> genes, working together.

								The wiring between neurons in the human brain allow us to

								After examining patients who had connections surgically severed

								objects after seeing them on the right of their field of vision, but not
								the left. The lack of connection stopped their ability to transfer the
								information ("This is a spoon.") from one hemisphere to the other, causing
								them to not recognize the object.

					Things as simple as living condition in rodents can affect a multitude of

					<p>
					For an organism to learn, it needs to be able to store the memory of what it has
					to learn from. No one is quite sure on how exactly the brain stores and
					retrieves memories. There are areas that the brain uses to "store" memories
					throughout the brain, each with a different use. The hippocampus is used
					more for spatial (or location-based) memories, the amygdala for emotion-based
					memories, and so on. Mice with genes controlling parts of their hippocampus had
					no trouble connecting a sound to an electric shock, but couldn't get through a maze,
					while those with genes that affected their amygdala changed could get through
					the maze fine, but didn't pick up on the relationship between the sound and the shock.

								Though mutations can occasionally be good, spreading new traits
								through future generations, they can be just as bad. Simple errors
								in nucleotides in DNA (an AGC turning into a CGA, for example), can
								cause major problems in the long run. Simple things like a single
								"misplaced" T could cause a different amino acid to be formed by the
								nucleotide, which can, in the long run, be catastrophic.

								<p>
								One result of mutation could be duplication of nucleotides. Not every
								nucleotide turns into the protein or amino acid it was meant to, and
								a second copy of the nucleotide could either aid, or hinder the organism.
								Conditions like Down Syndrome are thought to be caused by duplication of
								genes, and, though there can be pluses to having multiple of the same gene,
								there are also many negatives.

					The human brain, and all other brains for that matter, are products of evolution.
					None of the changes leading up to our "current model" happened overnight, but
					over the course of generations, and generations, and generations, through species,
					and species, and species. Though thousands of genes help in the making of arms
