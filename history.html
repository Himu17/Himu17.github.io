				<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-1">Brief History of the Vietnam War</a>
				<div id="accordion-1" class="accordion-section-content">
					<p style="text-indent: 3em;">The Vietnam War was originally a war between Vietnam and the French known as the Indochina war. In order to stop the spread of communism and to get better ties in with France, the US provided war goods and money to France to help defeat the Vietnamese. Through the help of of Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh, which was a group fighting for Vietnam’s independence. In may of 1954, the French finally surrendered, giving Vietnam their independence from France. Vietnam was split up into 2 different areas, North and South Vietnam. The North was controlled by communist leader Ho Chi Minh while the South was controlled by anti-communist Ngo Dinh Diem. Although Ngo was an anti-communist, he was a corrupt leader that oppressed the people of Vietnam, especially discriminated against Buddhism. in order to keep the people of vietnam from electing a communist leader, the US and Ngo cancelled the elections in 1956.This anger led to the start of the Viet Cong, which was a guerrilla force that was anti-communist and anti-Diem, later known as the National Liberation Front. Supported by Ho Chi Minh, the Viet Cong attacked hundreds of government officials in Southern Vietnam and was also strictly against America’s interference in the war. WHen Kennedy was in office, he sent thousands of soldiers to train the southern vietnamese soldiers to fight against communism. On November 1st 1963 a group of assassins supported by the US military assassinated Ngo Dinh Diem, after his attack on Buddhism and political corruption. Not long after, President Kennedy was assassinated, putting President Johnson now in charge. After an attack against the US, Johnson then set americans out into full on war with Viet Cong...

				<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-2">Effects of the Vietnam War on Civilians</a>
				<div id="accordion-2" class="accordion-section-content">
					<p style="text-indent: 3em;">During the Vietnam war, the US dropped over 7 million tons (14,000,000,000 pounds) explosives on Vietnamese, soldiers and civilians alike. This number was 3 times the amount of ordnance dropped by the US in the entirety of World War II. None of this accounted for the chemicals, such as napalm and Agent Orange, copiously dropped throughout the area. After the war, not counting the estimated 2 million civilian deaths, the infrastructure of Vietnam as a whole was ruined. Entire villages were demolished, and various chemical weapons and undetonated explosives littered the land. Americans had it much easier, in terms of literal destruction, being that none of the fighting was actually fought on the homefront. Most of the nation’s problems after the war were political, with massacres of civilians, like the one in My Lai, tarnishing America’s reputation as a defender of morals like freedom and democracy. President Nixon told the public that the war was necessary in order to stop the spread of communism, but after 9 years of American soldiers aiding the South Vietnamese Army, none of their help, both military and financial, was enough to work. No American civilians died in the war, but it cost the nation almost $1 trillion in modern dollars, causing some reform programs set in place by President Johnson to be canceled. If anything, American civilians lost confidence in their government, namely in its ability to judge whether or not a war was just or not, causing America to drop the Truman Doctrine, and not interfere in foreign military affairs for almost 20 years.

				<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-3">US Navy's Role in the Vietnam War</a>
				<div id="accordion-3" class="accordion-section-content">
					<p style="text-indent: 3em;">The US Navy had a big role in the Vietnam War. They supported the Air Force during campaigns against North Vietnam, and other operations in Laos and Cambodia. The Navy helped set up a blockade on the coast to prevent the enemy's from being resupplied, helped mission in Vietnam with naval gunfire support, and transportation of Marines. It protected commercial ships and other traffic, assisted allies, and indirected enemy troops and supplies. The US Navy helped the Southern Vietnamese create the Vietnam Navy (VNN), which became the fifth largest navy in the world at that time. The US Navy’s role in the Vietnam war enormous and contributed greatly to the end of the war.

				<div id="accordion-6" class="accordion-section-content">
					<p style="text-indent: 3em;">Not all Vietnam War veterans have huge difficulties in readjusting to civilian life, but not all Vietnam War veterans who return to civilian life completely disregard their military experience. The readjustment to civilian life is difficult for some because as soldiers, people are taught combat and defense to the point of automatic actions, such as breathing. The lives of people in the military are solely based on their lives, the lives of their peers, and the mission that they have been assigned. Training like this occurs for many months constantly and stays with that person forever. There are some aspects of the military and civilian life that interweave with each other, and there are some aspects in which they are greatly opposed to each other. Readjusting to civilian life is difficult for most veterans, and greatly affect their future lives.

Patrick Brophy-PB<br>
Ram Zallan-RZ<br><br></b>
<font style="line-height:200%;">
<b>[00:00:01] Ram Zallan:</b> So, can you tell us where you’re from and just generally introduce yourself?
<br>
<b>[00:00:04] Patrick Brophy:</b> sure, my name is Pat Brophy. I was born in Valdosta Georgia. 1954. My dad was in the air force. I grew up in Rhode Island and I joined the navy when I was 19 years old.
<br>
<b>[00:00:20] RZ:</b> Okay. Can you tell us a little bit about your childhood and just you’re growing up?
<br>
<b>[00:00:24] PB:</b> Sure, my mom was a school teacher. As I mentioned my dad was in the air force after he left the air force he became a conservation policeman. We lived in Charlestown Rhode Island southern along the beaches and then for a couples years in second and third grade we moved to St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands and then back to Rhode Island I continued through high school. After high school I was a carpenter for a while and built houses and worked in a mill, a textile mill. There wasn’t much opportunity in that area. It was a town of five hundred people, so there weren’t a lot of jobs to go around. I joined the military after I receiving a draft card that was going to put me in the army and I decided I’d rather be on a ship at sea than with a gun on shore and just told where to go to. I had interest in navigation for a long time because I grew up on the water.
<br>
<b>[00:01:36] RZ:</b> How old were you when the Vietnam War started?
<br>
<b>[00:01:39] PB:</b> Actually the Vietnam War began in 1957 so I was three. I don’t have a quiet of memory of that time but that’s when it started. The United States entered in the mid-sixties. Then it went through sixty nine and continued beyond that. A lot of activity continued behind the actual time that the politicians and the governments agreed they wouldn’t fight anymore. A lot of fighting continued. In 1974 is when I joined the United States navy. I asked them to send me to Australia and they said well we’ll get you as close as we can and they sent me to a ship offshore Vietnam. So I was there for about a year before the actual final evacuation of Vietnam. I didn’t fight on land. I did later in the navy serve with a lot of Vietnam veterans from that era. I'm technically a veteran even though I didn’t fight in the land because I served during that time period. I spent two years with a reserve unit of navy seals in special operations and learned a lot during their experiences during that time.
<br>
<b>[00:03:10] RZ:</b> You said you were three when the war started. Can you attest a little bit to how the war affected you growing up?
<br>
<b>[00:03:17] PB:</b> Well the country was pretty significantly affected during that time, especially in the mid-sixties. The peace movement, anti-war protests, people dodging the draft, going to Canada. The draft is when they make the decision for you to bring you in the military and send you to war for the necessity of the nation. a lot of people didn’t want to do that so, what they call dodging the draft, it was the age of rock and roll, drug experimentation, all kinds of things that messed with your mind, including the possibility of going to war. The war escalated gradually from 1957 on into the sixties and different peoples got involved. North Vietnam and South Vietnam, we’ll use the current names for them. Back then it was Viet Cong and other names. Basically it was the spread of communism that was the threat that the united states decided it needed to get involved about because they felt that if the china backed and Russia backed military equipment was being provided to north Vietnam in order to subdue south Vietnam, the united states was concerned that communism would then spread. They were the same time frame as the Bay of Pigs issue with John Kennedy and Cuba so there was big political concern on both sides of the US for this global spread of communism. They got involved to try to stop that. In the sixties, because there were a lot of people dying. The military has its tendency’s to draw its resources from young people. When mothers and fathers stay home and send their children off to war and they either don’t come back or they come back impaired psychologically or physically, it takes a toll on the country and society. They have a tendency to influence others to protest. It’s logical, it’s sensible, it’s the right thing for parents to do.
<br>
<b>[00:05:48]PB:</b> I went to it. I decided I didn’t want to be drafted and told where to go and what to do and who to shoot. I decided to go into navigation and stay in a ship out at sea. We were one mile out at sea so it wasn’t really that far. Johnson came in and he escalated the war, President Johnson that is after the Kennedy assassination. I was in fourth grade. I remember when Kennedy was assassinated. Johnson escalated the Vietnam war and then it went on to Nixon who finally after some time decided that he was going to pull out the troops and end the war because it was fighting and fighting and killing and killing and it wasn’t really gaining any ground. There was insurgencies, guerilla activity. Guerilla activity is when people hide in the forest. They take every trick out of their books. They had tunnels underground. They had bamboo stakes. All the stuff you see nowadays in the movies, it happened for real back then. Every resource at the human minds ingenuity in order to kill other people. Of course there were huge mistakes made where we bombed civilians and hurt people we shouldn’t have because of a lack of proper intelligence. 
<br>
<b>[00:07:18]PB:</b> Going through that period you had a lot of the musicians who were in the protest movement. Joan Baez, john Lennon, the Beatles, a lot of the songs that were popular were antiwar songs. Bob Dylan, a lot of those had a great influence over younger people like me. I was seventeen eighteen nineteen at the time. You’d hear the songs and you hear Crosby stills and Nash talk about the people who got shot putting flowers in guns at Ohio State. It has an impact on you so it grew to the point where the country said no this is wrong we’ve got to get out of there. Unfortunately a lot of people got hurt along the way. Towards the end of the sixties. Sixty nine I believe it was. It was when they decided to say okay the United States is not going to have fighting men over there anymore. We continued to support the southern Vietnamese for a while after that. They finally fell in I believe it was around March or April. Around March or April of 1975. I took a lot of pictures when we were there during that evacuation. I can remember seeing landing craft. Landing craft is one of those ships that carry a whole bunch of men and they drop the doors down on the sand and all the men run out with their guns. One of those was near us and people were trying to escape because the North Vietnamese had come in taking over Saigon and people were literally getting into boats to leave. I remember a helicopter landed on the deck of one of those and it’s not meant to land helicopters so that was a trick all in itself, but then they took on board so many people that the only place people could sit was on the propellers of the helicopter. You’d see the helicopter on a ship that it doesn’t belong on with the propellers bent over sideways and people sitting next to each other because that’s the only space available. We had quite a time then. It was difficult. We couldn’t help everybody. You just can’t but we tried. Several different ships offshore tried to take on people. When everybody left after that we thought it was over, but I can tell you a little story after maybe the next question of why these books are here because this is year’s later stuff that happened in Vietnam.
