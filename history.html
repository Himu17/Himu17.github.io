				<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-1">Brief History of the Vietnam War</a>
				<div id="accordion-1" class="accordion-section-content">
					<p style="text-indent: 3em;">The Vietnam War was originally a war between Vietnam and the French known as the Indochina war. In order to stop the spread of communism and to get better ties in with France, the US provided war goods and money to France to help defeat the Vietnamese. Through the help of of Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh, which was a group fighting for Vietnam’s independence. In may of 1954, the French finally surrendered, giving Vietnam their independence from France. Vietnam was split up into 2 different areas, North and South Vietnam. The North was controlled by communist leader Ho Chi Minh while the South was controlled by anti-communist Ngo Dinh Diem. Although Ngo was an anti-communist, he was a corrupt leader that oppressed the people of Vietnam, especially discriminated against Buddhism. in order to keep the people of vietnam from electing a communist leader, the US and Ngo cancelled the elections in 1956.This anger led to the start of the Viet Cong, which was a guerrilla force that was anti-communist and anti-Diem, later known as the National Liberation Front. Supported by Ho Chi Minh, the Viet Cong attacked hundreds of government officials in Southern Vietnam and was also strictly against America’s interference in the war. WHen Kennedy was in office, he sent thousands of soldiers to train the southern vietnamese soldiers to fight against communism. On November 1st 1963 a group of assassins supported by the US military assassinated Ngo Dinh Diem, after his attack on Buddhism and political corruption. Not long after, President Kennedy was assassinated, putting President Johnson now in charge. After an attack against the US, Johnson then set americans out into full on war with Viet Cong...

				<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-2">Effects of the Vietnam War on Civilians</a>
				<div id="accordion-2" class="accordion-section-content">
					<p style="text-indent: 3em;">During the Vietnam war, the US dropped over 7 million tons (14,000,000,000 pounds) explosives on Vietnamese, soldiers and civilians alike. This number was 3 times the amount of ordnance dropped by the US in the entirety of World War II. None of this accounted for the chemicals, such as napalm and Agent Orange, copiously dropped throughout the area. After the war, not counting the estimated 2 million civilian deaths, the infrastructure of Vietnam as a whole was ruined. Entire villages were demolished, and various chemical weapons and undetonated explosives littered the land. Americans had it much easier, in terms of literal destruction, being that none of the fighting was actually fought on the homefront. Most of the nation’s problems after the war were political, with massacres of civilians, like the one in My Lai, tarnishing America’s reputation as a defender of morals like freedom and democracy. President Nixon told the public that the war was necessary in order to stop the spread of communism, but after 9 years of American soldiers aiding the South Vietnamese Army, none of their help, both military and financial, was enough to work. No American civilians died in the war, but it cost the nation almost $1 trillion in modern dollars, causing some reform programs set in place by President Johnson to be canceled. If anything, American civilians lost confidence in their government, namely in its ability to judge whether or not a war was just or not, causing America to drop the Truman Doctrine, and not interfere in foreign military affairs for almost 20 years.

				<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-3">US Navy's Role in the Vietnam War</a>
				<div id="accordion-3" class="accordion-section-content">
					<p style="text-indent: 3em;">The US Navy had a big role in the Vietnam War. They supported the Air Force during campaigns against North Vietnam, and other operations in Laos and Cambodia. The Navy helped set up a blockade on the coast to prevent the enemy's from being resupplied, helped mission in Vietnam with naval gunfire support, and transportation of Marines. It protected commercial ships and other traffic, assisted allies, and indirected enemy troops and supplies. The US Navy helped the Southern Vietnamese create the Vietnam Navy (VNN), which became the fifth largest navy in the world at that time. The US Navy’s role in the Vietnam war enormous and contributed greatly to the end of the war.

				<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-6">American Readjustment to Civilian Life</a>
				<div id="accordion-6" class="accordion-section-content">
					<p style="text-indent: 3em;">Not all Vietnam War veterans have huge difficulties in readjusting to civilian life, but not all Vietnam War veterans who return to civilian life completely disregard their military experience. The readjustment to civilian life is difficult for some because as soldiers, people are taught combat and defense to the point of automatic actions, such as breathing. The lives of people in the military are solely based on their lives, the lives of their peers, and the mission that they have been assigned. Training like this occurs for many months constantly and stays with that person forever. There are some aspects of the military and civilian life that interweave with each other, and there are some aspects in which they are greatly opposed to each other. Readjusting to civilian life is difficult for most veterans, and greatly affect their future lives.

Patrick Brophy-PB<br>
Ram Zallan-RZ<br><br></b>
<font style="line-height:200%;">

<b>[00:00:01] Ram Zallan:</b> So, can you tell us where you’re from and just generally introduce yourself?
<br>
<b>[00:00:04] Patrick Brophy:</b> sure, my name is Pat Brophy. I was born in Valdosta Georgia. 1954. My dad was in the air force. I grew up in Rhode Island and I joined the navy when I was 19 years old.
<br>
<b>[00:00:20] RZ:</b> Okay. Can you tell us a little bit about your childhood and just you’re growing up?
<br>
<b>[00:00:24] PB:</b> Sure, my mom was a school teacher. As I mentioned my dad was in the air force after he left the air force he became a conservation policeman. We lived in Charlestown Rhode Island southern along the beaches and then for a couples years in second and third grade we moved to St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands and then back to Rhode Island I continued through high school. After high school I was a carpenter for a while and built houses and worked in a mill, a textile mill. There wasn’t much opportunity in that area. It was a town of five hundred people, so there weren’t a lot of jobs to go around. I joined the military after I receiving a draft card that was going to put me in the army and I decided I’d rather be on a ship at sea than with a gun on shore and just told where to go to. I had interest in navigation for a long time because I grew up on the water.
<br>
<b>[00:01:36] RZ:</b> How old were you when the Vietnam War started?
<br>
<b>[00:01:39] PB:</b> Actually the Vietnam War began in 1957 so I was three. I don’t have a quiet of memory of that time but that’s when it started. The United States entered in the mid-sixties. Then it went through sixty nine and continued beyond that. A lot of activity continued behind the actual time that the politicians and the governments agreed they wouldn’t fight anymore. A lot of fighting continued. In 1974 is when I joined the United States navy. I asked them to send me to Australia and they said well we’ll get you as close as we can and they sent me to a ship offshore Vietnam. So I was there for about a year before the actual final evacuation of Vietnam. I didn’t fight on land. I did later in the navy serve with a lot of Vietnam veterans from that era. I'm technically a veteran even though I didn’t fight in the land because I served during that time period. I spent two years with a reserve unit of navy seals in special operations and learned a lot during their experiences during that time.
<br>
<b>[00:03:10] RZ:</b> You said you were three when the war started. Can you attest a little bit to how the war affected you growing up?
<br>
<b>[00:03:17] PB:</b> Well the country was pretty significantly affected during that time, especially in the mid-sixties. The peace movement, anti-war protests, people dodging the draft, going to Canada. The draft is when they make the decision for you to bring you in the military and send you to war for the necessity of the nation. a lot of people didn’t want to do that so, what they call dodging the draft, it was the age of rock and roll, drug experimentation, all kinds of things that messed with your mind, including the possibility of going to war. The war escalated gradually from 1957 on into the sixties and different peoples got involved. North Vietnam and South Vietnam, we’ll use the current names for them. Back then it was Viet Cong and other names. Basically it was the spread of communism that was the threat that the united states decided it needed to get involved about because they felt that if the china backed and Russia backed military equipment was being provided to north Vietnam in order to subdue south Vietnam, the united states was concerned that communism would then spread. They were the same time frame as the Bay of Pigs issue with John Kennedy and Cuba so there was big political concern on both sides of the US for this global spread of communism. They got involved to try to stop that. In the sixties, because there were a lot of people dying. The military has its tendency’s to draw its resources from young people. When mothers and fathers stay home and send their children off to war and they either don’t come back or they come back impaired psychologically or physically, it takes a toll on the country and society. They have a tendency to influence others to protest. It’s logical, it’s sensible, it’s the right thing for parents to do.
<br>
<b>[00:05:48] PB:</b> I went to it. I decided I didn’t want to be drafted and told where to go and what to do and who to shoot. I decided to go into navigation and stay in a ship out at sea. We were one mile out at sea so it wasn’t really that far. Johnson came in and he escalated the war, President Johnson that is after the Kennedy assassination. I was in fourth grade. I remember when Kennedy was assassinated. Johnson escalated the Vietnam war and then it went on to Nixon who finally after some time decided that he was going to pull out the troops and end the war because it was fighting and fighting and killing and killing and it wasn’t really gaining any ground. There was insurgencies, guerilla activity. Guerilla activity is when people hide in the forest. They take every trick out of their books. They had tunnels underground. They had bamboo stakes. All the stuff you see nowadays in the movies, it happened for real back then. Every resource at the human minds ingenuity in order to kill other people. Of course there were huge mistakes made where we bombed civilians and hurt people we shouldn’t have because of a lack of proper intelligence. 
<br>
<b>[00:07:18] PB:</b> Going through that period you had a lot of the musicians who were in the protest movement. Joan Baez, John Lennon, the Beatles, a lot of the songs that were popular were antiwar songs. Bob Dylan, a lot of those had a great influence over younger people like me. I was seventeen eighteen nineteen at the time. You’d hear the songs and you hear Crosby stills and Nash talk about the people who got shot putting flowers in guns at Ohio State. It has an impact on you so it grew to the point where the country said no this is wrong we’ve got to get out of there. Unfortunately a lot of people got hurt along the way. Towards the end of the sixties. Sixty nine I believe it was. It was when they decided to say okay the United States is not going to have fighting men over there anymore. We continued to support the southern Vietnamese for a while after that. They finally fell in I believe it was around March or April. Around March or April of 1975. I took a lot of pictures when we were there during that evacuation. I can remember seeing landing craft. Landing craft is one of those ships that carry a whole bunch of men and they drop the doors down on the sand and all the men run out with their guns. One of those was near us and people were trying to escape because the North Vietnamese had come in taking over Saigon and people were literally getting into boats to leave. I remember a helicopter landed on the deck of one of those and it’s not meant to land helicopters so that was a trick all in itself, but then they took on board so many people that the only place people could sit was on the propellers of the helicopter. You’d see the helicopter on a ship that it doesn’t belong on with the propellers bent over sideways and people sitting next to each other because that’s the only space available. We had quite a time then. It was difficult. We couldn’t help everybody. You just can’t but we tried. Several different ships offshore tried to take on people. When everybody left after that we thought it was over, but I can tell you a little story after maybe the next question of why these books are here because this is year’s later stuff that happened in Vietnam.
<br>
<b>[00:10:24] RZ: </b>If you could describe the Vietnam War in as few words preferably one word what would it be?
<br>
<b>[00:10:34] PB: </b>Can I do two words?
<br>
<b>[00:10:35] RZ:</b> You can use a few words, yeah.
<br>
<b>[00:10:36] PB:</b> Big mistake.
<br>
<b>[00:10:38] RZ:</b> Why do you think it was a big mistake?
<br>
<b>[00:10:41] PB:</b> It was a mistake because we got involved in something that just grew and grew and grew out of control. It hurt a lot of people and in the end, after so many years, what would have happened originally happened anyway. So, if you get to the same place you started after twenty years, what have you accomplished? You’ve made a mistake, right?
<br>
<b>[00:11:13] RZ:</b> You said that you were in the Navy and you also served alongside some seals. What was your highest position throughout your entire service when you were in the Navy?
<br>
<b>[00:11:25] PB: </b>As I mentioned I started in 1974. I was in for twelve years. I worked my way up nine enlisted levels to senior chief petty officer. Excuse me, eight enlisted levels, to senior chief petty officer. Then I became an officer with enlisted service as, what they call, an O-1E. It’s an ensign with prior enlisted service and that was the highest position that I held.
<br>
<b>[00:11:58] RZ:</b> How would you describe the living conditions throughout the war? How they may have differed.
<br>
<b>[00:12:06] PB: </b>Well, I guess you know everybody understands because they’ve seen all the bio pics and movies about Vietnam. I can only speak from that perspective as I mentioned that I didn’t go on land fighting in the Vietnam War prior to 69'. The way I mentioned before about being guerilla warfare, I mean its everything you see nowadays about people who are just walking through a jungle with what they have on their back or in their hands or can carry and using what information they have and trying to get back to the camp. On a lot of the exercises I did with the reservists, who were Vietnam veterans, we would use sea rations, I still carry on my belt a little John Wayne they call it, it’s a can opener. So you’d eat canned food, it wouldn’t be hot, and that’s when you had it. For the people who got injured it was horrendous if they weren’t able to get back to the medical facilities. For people like, I was I the Navy, it was just a lot of time sitting and waiting or doing things that prepared you for every possibility in case you had to respond to certain things.
<br>
<b>[00:13:49] RZ: </b>Did you make any friends while you were serving?
<br>
<b>[00:13:54] PB:</b> Yeah, I made a lot of friends. I was on a destroyer and on a ship you live with about 60 people in the same bedroom, every single night. You have to have their back, they have to have your back. When I served with the seals and the special operations people it was down to a five man group that had to have your back. It was even tighter because that was real guerrilla warfare. I was involved in special operations, preparations in other areas, based upon the lessons that we learned in Vietnam, Central America, I won’t name more specific than that. I made a lot of friends. I haven’t been in touch with them since then, but when you’re that intimate and your life is that dependent on other people you get close to them. You care for them.
<br>
<b>[00:15:05] RZ: </b>Do you have any memories about your service that stand out?
<br>
<b>[00:15:11] PB:</b> Yeah, I have quite a few. Actually, some of them relate to Vietnam itself. One of the most significant ones, and part of the reason why I was selected, I believe anyway, as the 1985 Sailor the year was that in 1977 we were passing Vietnam, and you’ll notice this is 1977, supposedly long after the war ended, and there were still people, boat people they called them, trying to get out of south Vietnam, well it was the one Vietnam then, but they were still trying to leave. One afternoon our ship was going along in a monsoon south of Vietnam and I noticed something white on the horizon. It almost looked like it could have been a milk carton floating on the waves. It was popping up and down but it about 5 or 6 miles away, which is just at the curvature of the horizon, for a ship at the height that we were looking at. I went up to what they called the big eyes. The big eyes are huge binoculars, they’re about 2 1/2 feet long and the ends of them are big around as your head, so you can see pretty far. I looked into it and it looked to me like somebody was waving a flag, so I went down and told the captain and he said well bring the ship over there Brophy. I was the conning officer at that time, I was enlisted but I was still given the ability to con a full destroyer. We went over closer and we found out it was a swamped thirty foot boat. It had about 35 or 40 people in it, including a 98 year old woman and a nine month pregnant woman. We rescued them that afternoon, brought them on board. They were going to die at sea. They were out to far to get back and their boat was swamped, it only had 6 inches of wood sticking up over the gunnel and it was full of water. Later on that same night we were going along and on the same side of the ship we were passing along the south part of Vietnam. I saw a light and I went out to the starboard bridge, it was about one o’clock in the morning, [inaudible] the captain was sitting out there. It had cleared up a little bit, the waves were still rough but the rain had stopped. I saw this light flashing. Now near the countries all along Asia, there are a lot of fisherman and they use lights at night to attract fish. It’s not uncommon to see fishing boats out there with lights flashing as the way they bounce on the waves over the horizon. I looked at it and I recognized something and I read off to the captain. I said dot-dot-dot-dash-dash-dash-dot-dot-dot. That means SOS in Morse code. As soon as I read it off to the captain, he heard me say it. He said let’s bring it over again. Another boat we found. Another thirty some people. The end of the day, the same day, we had rescued seventy seven people. They gave me a lot of credit for that because I was the vigilant person who saw the signs for help. We did end up on our way to Thailand we dropped all these people off at Thailand. They all get sent back to the United States and we later on got a letter form a doctor in Colorado because we had rescued the doctor’s mother. It was pretty special, so yeah that’s a significant event because we saved some people's lives.
<br>
<b>[00:19:10] RZ:</b> Do you now about what year that happened?
<br>
<b>[00:19:12] PB:</b> 1977. Let me check because I’ve got a book right here. There, seventy seven refugees from Vietnamese waters. The ninth of august 1978. I apologize, imp off by one year. Here's pictures of the people, if you want to take any of these pictures. This is one of the boats that they were in.
<br>
<b>[00:19:40] RZ:</b> You said earlier you had described the war, as a whole, as a big mistake. Do you think it was necessary or unnecessary for the US to intervene?
<br>
<b>[00:19:51] PB:</b> It’s hard to judge the past because back then they didn’t have the communication that we have nowadays. They didn’t have the people with the intelligence that we have nowadays and the newer electronic capabilities. When we were sitting off of Vietnam we would get mail by a helicopter once a month. There was no such thing as email. There was no such thing as cellphones. There was no such thing, during war, as being in touch with anybody except with what they wanted you to be in touch with. You couldn’t do it. That capability wasn’t there. As far as having the right information to make the decisions that politicians make when they decide these things, you’d be second guessing at this point to think that they knew everything that they needed to know back then. They probably made the best decisions they could with what they had. When you’re dealing with national security and a country that has been threatened on both sides, the east coast and the west coast, with communism. In Vietnam, it’s understood that Russia, at the time, and china, at the time, were giving weapons and armament to North Vietnam under the agenda of expanding communism. If you think of it that way and you go back to when I was young, there was a great fear that we could be taken over or infiltrated by communists. We didn’t agree with that, as a country, as a people. The only way we responded to it was to try to stop it, so it’s hard to say. It’s easy in hindsight to be critical. It was a mistake, in hindsight because it didn’t work out, but can you say that they made the wrong decisions at the time with what they know? I can’t say that.
<br>
<b>[00:22:03] RZ:</b> What did you do after the war, or after your service?
<br>
<b>[00:22:08] PB: </b>Well, let’s see. What did I do? I spent twelve years in the navy. You asked me what position I had. When I became an ensign, as an officer, I was put in charge of the transfer of nuclear weapons at sea, which is pretty high security and high responsibility. I left to take care of my family because going to sea was not serving them well. My own children. I left and the first job I could get was nowhere near what I was doing in the military. I had to start all over with my life as a graveyard shift security guard and minimum wage. That led me to twelve years in the hotel business because basically, what I said was if I can run a ship that’s horizontally on the ocean, I can run an apartment building that’s vertical up into the sky. Right? A ship has a lot of people, needs to stay clean and a lot of rooms and a hotel is very similar. It worked out for me. Short term I became a general manager in the hotel business then I moved on to food service. Basically what I’m doing now is food service accounting. So, twelve years, twelve years, fourteen years, and four years.
<br>
<b>[00:23:49] RZ:</b> How would you say your service affected your life, as a whole, after the war had ended?
<br>
<b>[00:23:54] PB:</b> Well, let me answer the first question first. The service affected my life enormously because I grew up a lot. As I mentioned to you, I grew up in a town of five hundred people. In that town back then the people in that town where all white and prejudice against American Indians. That’s pretty fine prejudice when the Indians were here first. I went out into the world. I lived with people on ships from every nationality. I got to know a lot of people with a lot of backgrounds and respect them all. That grew me up. After my service time, obviously I had to re-civilianize myself because you can’t just come back into the civilian world and give orders to people because nobody's subordinate to you and there aren’t ranks, rules, and laws that are the same. I had to spend two or three years with people making fun of me because how rigid I was before I settled down. I think it helped me to go into the hospitality business where they ask you to be nice to people and smile every day. That was a good environment for me maturing, but the military helped me to grow up from being a 1960s teenager to a more responsible person. 
<br>
<b>[00:25:30] RZ:</b> What was your relationship after the war with any friends you made during the war after parting ways? 
<br>
<b>[00:25:38] PB:</b> No relationship at all. I left it all behind. Moved on.
<br>
<b>[00:25:44] RZ: </b>How did you feel being able to reunited with your friends and family back home?
<br>
<b>[00:25:48] PB:</b> It was fantastic. You feel guilty when you have to be sent away all the time. Especially in ships, the navy being different than that air force and the army and land based services, you spend a lot of time out in the ocean. You can’t bring your family with you on the ship and they would do long deployments. I remember playing volleyball in Iraq in 1975, long, long before any of the recent issues with Iraq. We spent nine months on deployment so nine months out of the year you’re not at home. Then when you come home and your ship is there you still have to work a full week. It’s a tough task that takes a special person to be able to do that, and especially those, god bless them, who spend their lives doing it. 
<br>
<b>[00:26:49] RZ:</b> Do you ever have regrets of your service? Of just serving.
<br>
<b>[00:26:55] PB:</b> The one regret I have is that I left early and I’m not getting any retirement from it, but other than that no. I think it served me well and it changed my life a lot. It brought me out here from the little town in Rhode Island. I’m fairly happy with where I am today. With the good and the bad, how it all ends up to where I am today, I would do it again. 
<br>
<b>[00:27:29] RZ:</b> Where do you think you would be now if you hadn’t served?
<br>
<b>[00:27:36] PB:</b> I would probably be working in a mill at minimum wage, in the place where I grew up, not knowing what the world was like or other peoples and in a very just small town environment. I wouldn’t be the person I am.
<br>
<b>[00:27:57] RZ:</b> Could you expand a little bit on how your participation of all your service changed you?
<br>
<b>[00:28:04] PB:</b> As I mentioned. It grew me up very quickly. You have to follow rules, you have to be obedient, you have to give orders, and you have to know what you’re talking about before you talk about it. You go through a lot of training. Its good preparation for a short period of time if you don’t have to go to war for getting into the working world and experiencing the pressures of hard work. I think service to the country is a great educational period if you’re not able to or don’t want to go through college. Honestly if I were to back myself up to answer the last questions maybe a little better, as an after though. I would have much preferred to go to college and come out with some sort of career that I chose rather than have had to serve in the military. I just wasn’t in that position. We didn’t have the resources for me to go to college so that was the best option for me to move forwards. I think that for me it worked out well.
<br>
<b>[00:29:18] RZ:</b> You were talking bout how you were mainly stationed on a boat offshore. Did you ever see any combat?
<br>
<b>[00:29:26] PB:</b> Yeah. In fact I was shot at [laughter] one time. And believe it or not that was in the 1980s. That was a strange one in the middle of the night. It was a patrol boat that was shooting at us. Well, we were told it was a fishing boat so whichever it was, it had guns and was shooting at me. Anyway, those things happen when you’re out there. Prior to the evacuation we had some ships, small boats, military vessels, of the South Vietnamese at the time come up to us and ask for asylum. In one case we were ordered to turn them away because we just couldn’t, at that point, take sides. Probably if they had jumped off their boat, take off their uniforms, we could’ve taken them on board but I don’t know. Decisions like that were way over my head at that point. We saw that the boat was, we don’t know if the people were in it or not, but it went around the corner of the island and blew up. So somebody shot it or they blew it up themselves and swam to shore to get out of there. I don’t know, but that happened. We never saw, other than the bombs over the horizon, explosions at night, which makes you think a lot. No, I never saw anybody get killed and thank god I never had to kill anybody myself. 
<br>
<b>[00:31:19] RZ: </b>Are there any final words or thoughts you’d like to share?
<br>
<b>[00:31:25] PB:</b> I mentioned to my son earlier that some of the things that I went through I was going to choose not to speak about because they’re personal, private, and maybe in some cases because I was serving in the military those secrets belong to the government. I ask that we respect that and if I’ve left anything out there’s a purpose. I appreciate you guys and what you’re doing. I hope that maybe the story will help you to decide to pursue an education so that you have choices that you can make that I wasn’t able to make. I was left with the option of going in the military or be drafted. That’s not much of a choice but I chose the navy over the army. What I would say is that while the military was my way of getting out of the small town, becoming a, if you will, a man of the world, understanding different peoples, different countries, different cultures, and different societies and having respect for them. You can do it through a good education and a lot of good friends who also teach you the same sort of things. If you have a choice to make, I would say stick to a good education, have respect for everybody from every country, every culture. Just like I said about when I started in a place where there were 500 people you can’t choose where you being but you can make choices along the way that help you out throughout your life to improve yourself and help those around you.
<br>
<b>[00:33:29] RZ:</b> Could you walk us through these books, magazines? Just generally what’s inside them?
<br>
<b>[00:33:36] PB:</b> All Hands is a navy magazine. August 1981 issue. I was serving in a reserve unit with the seals and we were practicing some things. They wanted me to become a seal. They actually ran me in the ground to try to get me to become a seal. I just wasn’t up to it. We would go running and running was running. It was no jogging, it was leg out vertical type of run. They were hard, but I worked with them. That’s me driving that boat right there. This is a rivering patrol boat. If you’ve ever seen the movie Apocalypse Now©, this is the boat they used in Vietnam and I was a boat captain of one of those. These are the guys that I was serving with and all of them are seals. We would be support in special operations for them. That's one things. There’s another book that I have up there when I was the sailor of the year. I think part of the sailor of the year came from this issue where we saved lives because they recognized me for that. This is the book that shows the boats that I explained that we found from the white flag and from the SOS showing the people coming on board. These are the people, the Vietnamese refugees. Again 1978 so were talking three years after the evacuation of Vietnam people are still trying to get out of there for whatever reason to a better life, or away from whatever life they had. It explains in here, the small junk was clearly unfit for travel on the open ocean. The refugees were embarked. Many of their crew contributed clothing for their new shipmates. They didn’t even have clothes on their backs. It would keep them warm. It’s a yearbook. 1977-1978 the USS Francis Hammond and it has all the stories, the different places that we visited, the different people. It’s just memories. This sheet of paper is a commendation I got for being the person who recognized those boats. I just keep it here for so my kids can look at me as a hero. I’m kidding. [Laughter]
<br>
<b>[00:36:25] RZ:</b> I think that concludes the interview. Thank you very much for doing this for us.
<br>
<b>[00:36:26] PB: </b>Sure, sure thank you guys.
